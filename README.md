## District Summary 
**Description:**
The District Summary output gives us a high-level view of how many schools, the combined budget, average test scores, and percent of students who passed in the test categories within the district

## School Summary
**Description:**
The School Summary output shows the reader how much money schools can spend per student, what the average test scores and passing rates are based on each school

## Top 5 Schools
**Description:**
The Top 5 view shows us the 5 highest performing schools by overall passing rate performance in math and reading

## Bottom 5 Schools
**Description:**
The Bottom 5 view shows us the 5 lowest performing schools by overall passing rate performance in math and reading

## Math Scores by Grade
**Description:**
Math Scores by Grade is a breakdown of average math test scores by grade for each school

## Size Summary
**Description:**
The Size Summary table shows the average test scores and passing rates of students based on their school size grouping

## Conclusions
My deductions from the analyses are as follows:
- Oddly enough for this district, more spending per capita and test results were inversely related. More spending = worse passing rates and vice versa
- overall, charter schools outperform district schools in all categories, specifically passing rates. 
- Although district schools average math score per student is passing (>70), all district schools are failing in the passing rate for math. Focuses is needed for the math departments in district schools
- A reason that small and medium schools outperform large schools is that all of the charter schools fit the small to medium category while there are only district schools in the large categoy
